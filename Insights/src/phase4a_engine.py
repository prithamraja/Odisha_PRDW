# Phase 4a: All Pattern Types on View 1
# =============================================================================
# Extends Phase 2 with 10 new pattern type evaluators (11 total).
# The engine architecture, caching, HDP construction, scoring, and
# orchestrator are unchanged from phase2_engine.py — only the pattern
# evaluator registry, detect_pattern, and run_engine loop are updated.
#
# New pattern types added:
#   Categorical: OUTSTANDING_LAST, TOP_TWO, LAST_TWO, EVENNESS, ATTRIBUTION
#   Temporal:    TREND, OUTLIER, SEASONALITY, CHANGE_POINT, UNIMODALITY
#
# Outputs:
#   metainsights/view1_all_patterns_candidates.json
#   reports/engine_diagnostics_all_patterns.txt
#
# Run from project root:
#   python src/phase4a_engine.py

# =============================================================================
# ADDITIONAL VIEW CONFIGS (Views 2, 3)
# =============================================================================
# Domain: Odisha Panchayati Raj & Drinking Water. Built by
# domain_pack_prdw/views/. Three views ship in v1 and there is no view 4-9:
# mapping doc §4.4 rules out an equity or journey view on this drop (no
# beneficiary-grain data exists anywhere in it, `activity_nsap` has zero rows,
# and the SC/ST components are near-empty), and the asset dimensions fold into
# view1 because activity_asset is 1:1 with activities. If statewide NSAP or
# beneficiary tables arrive, a fourth view is a pack addition, not a redesign.
#
# The scale switch is imported from phase2_engine, next to VIEW1_CONFIG, so all
# three views read one flag. See the comment there.

# view2 is the only view with a temporal axis, and that is the point of §5. The
# activity tables carry a reporting artifact at FY 2023-24 (costless activities
# begin being recorded, so activity counts jump ~8x); the cashbook does not —
# payments run 156/138/92/93/96/111 million rupees across the same six years.
# So ALL temporal mining happens here, on cash and sanction measures, over the
# full 72-month window.
#
# `fiscal_year` is deliberately in BOTH lists: as a categorical dimension it
# filters ("within 2024-2025, how do the months behave"), and as a temporal
# dimension it is a six-point series the trend and change-point evaluators can
# read. The engine offers it as a breakdown from both lists, so a handful of
# data scopes are enumerated twice per subspace; the pattern cache serves the
# repeat and the HDP dedup set drops the duplicate candidate, so the cost is
# enumeration time on a 1,440-row view and nothing else.
