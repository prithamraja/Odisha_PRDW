# Phase 5: Intra-View Ranking & Presentation (Layers 3 + 3P)
# =============================================================================
# Takes raw MetaInsight candidates from each view (Phase 4b output) and
# produces a ranked top-k list per view using the paper's greedy second-order
# approximation of TotalUse maximisation (Section 4.3).
#
# Selects candidates with high individual scores and low inter-MetaInsight
# redundancy. Also generates Layer 2P (raw explorer) and Layer 3P (ranked
# dashboard) presentation reports.

    Overlap ratio between two MetaInsights in [0, 1].

    ITERATION 3 — the eligibility test is tightened by ONE added requirement:
    two candidates overlap only if, on top of sharing the extending strategy and
    the pattern type as before, they also share at least one of {measure,
    breakdown, a non-trivial subspace}.

    Why. The gate used to be strategy + pattern type alone, and the formulas
    below then paid out 0.30 (subspace strategy) or 0.40 (measure and breakdown
    strategies) for a bare extending-dimension match. That is enough to remove a
    real finding on its own: in iteration 2 the eKYC backlog scored 0.5474
    against view2's rank-15 line of 0.5032 — it earned its place — and was
    dropped by a single 0.3832 overlap with a candidate that shared nothing with
    it but a pattern type and the dimension it was extended along, over a
    different measure, a different breakdown and a disjoint subspace. Two
    findings that share only the axis they were sliced along are not saying the
    same thing to a reader, so they are no longer charged for it.

    Formula BEFORE:
        eligible  <- strategy match AND pattern-type match
        subspace  : 0.40*sub + 0.30*ext + 0.15*msr + 0.15*bkd
        measure   : 0.60*sub + 0.40*bkd
        breakdown : 0.60*sub + 0.40*msr
    Formula AFTER:
        eligible  <- the BEFORE test, AND _shares_any_content(mi1, mi2)
        the three weighted formulas are unchanged.

    WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO, because a first pass at it did and the
    result was measurably worse: it does not require the extending dimensions to
    MATCH. Two candidates with the same pattern type, the same measure, the same
    breakdown and the same subspace, differing only in which dimension the HDP
    was extended along, are about as redundant as two candidates can be — they
    are one finding written three ways. Gating on an extending-dimension match
    scores exactly those pairs at ZERO overlap, and the top-15s fill with them:
    with that gate in place view4's ranked list spent six of its fifteen slots
    on two findings repeated across three extending dimensions each, and three
    patterns that iteration 2 had recovered were pushed out of the list
    altogether. The requirement that belongs here is shared CONTENT, which is
    what removed P4's phantom overlap; an extending-dimension gate addresses
    nothing and costs real findings.

    Only the gate moved. Nothing that overlapped substantively before overlaps
    less now, and detection is untouched — this is a ranking term.
