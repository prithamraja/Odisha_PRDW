# =============================================================================
# Phase 5b (Revised): Dual Executive Reports
# =============================================================================
# Generates two complementary reports from the same MetaInsight candidates:
#
#   1. Overview Report (gamma=0.1)
#      Status briefing with leadline paragraphs + bullet-point facts.
#      Answers: "What's broadly true about PM-JAY in UP?"
#
#   2. Actionable Insights Report (gamma=0.5)
#      Investigation brief with bold one-line headlines + numbered evidence.
#      Answers: "Where do things break, and what should we look into?"
#
# Both reports are generated from the same candidate JSONs, rescored
# with the appropriate gamma value, then enriched with quantitative
# stats from the parquet files before being sent to the LLM.
#
# Outputs:
#   reports/overview_report.md
#   reports/actionable_insights_report.md
#
# Run from Metainsights_anomalies/:
#   python src/phase5b_dual_reports.py

## Your Audience
A senior state programme officer who manages PM-JAY operations across UP. She is non-technical but understands healthcare operations and programme metrics. This is a status briefing -- she wants to understand the overall state of the programme before a quarterly review meeting.

## This Section: {view_info['title']}

{view_info['description']}

## Column Glossary
{json.dumps(view_info['column_glossary'], indent=2)}

## Findings (ranked by importance)

{findings_json}

## Instructions

Write a clear overview section. Follow this exact format:

1. STRUCTURE: Group findings into 3-5 thematic areas. Each thematic area has:
   - A **leadline**: 2-3 sentences summarising the theme in plain English. This is a narrative paragraph, not a bullet.
   - **Supporting bullets**: 3-6 bullet points using markdown dash syntax (- ) with specific numbers from the stats field. Each bullet is one fact -- concise, with the number front and centre.

2. EXAMPLE FORMAT:

   ### Spending is concentrated in two specialties

   PM-JAY spending in UP is overwhelmingly driven by Cardiology and Orthopaedics. These two specialties account for nearly two-thirds of all claim amounts, and this pattern holds across every division in the state.

   - Cardiology: INR 401.9 crore claimed (39.4% of total)
   - Orthopaedics: INR 260.2 crore claimed (25.5% of total)
   - Next largest: OBG at INR 8.50 crore, General Surgery at INR 7.22 crore
   - Pattern holds across all 18 divisions with no exceptions
   - Base package amounts show the same concentration: Cardiology at 42.7% of base amount

3. RULES:
   - Use plain English, spell out specialty codes on first use
   - Use INR and crore/lakh for financial amounts. Use plain numbers for counts, days, rates.
   - Every bullet must contain a specific number from the stats
   - Leadlines are narrative (no bullets, no numbers). Bullets are facts (numbers, concise).
   - Do NOT mention scores, conciseness, impact, HDP, extending strategies, or technical terms
   - Do NOT invent numbers not in the stats
   - Do NOT include follow-up questions or recommendations -- this is a factual overview
   - Keep it to 400-700 words total

## Findings (ranked by importance, filtered for actionability)

These findings were specifically selected to highlight patterns that hold broadly but break in specific places. The exceptions are the actionable part.

{findings_json}

## Instructions

Write a set of actionable insights. Follow this exact format:

1. STRUCTURE: Present each insight (or closely related group of 2-3 insights) as:
   - A **one-line headline** in bold that tells the full story in one sentence, including the exception. The reader should understand the insight completely from this line alone.
   - **Numbered bullets** using markdown numbered list syntax (1. 2. 3.) with 3-6 items of supporting evidence, specific numbers, and context.

2. EXAMPLE FORMAT:

   **Cardiology and Orthopaedics dominate PM-JAY spending in 17 of 18 divisions -- except Basti, where General Surgery leads instead.**

   1. Statewide, Cardiology accounts for INR 401.9 crore (39.4%) and Orthopaedics INR 260.2 crore (25.5%) of total claim amounts
   2. This pattern holds across 17 of 18 divisions -- every division except Basti
   3. In Basti, General Surgery overtakes both, accounting for 34% of local claims vs Cardiology at 28%
   4. The concentration is even stronger in base package amounts: Cardiology alone is 42.7% of total base amount
   5. Implication: Basti's different specialty mix may reflect local hospital capabilities, referral patterns, or coding practices worth reviewing

3. HEADLINE RULES:
   - Must be a single sentence
   - Must state the broad pattern AND the exception(s) by name
   - Must be self-contained -- a reader who only reads headlines should get the full picture
   - For universal patterns (no exceptions), the headline states what's consistent and why it matters
   - Use specific entity names: district names, specialty names, hospital types -- not "some districts"

4. BULLET RULES:
   - Every bullet must contain a specific number from the stats
   - Use INR and crore/lakh for financial amounts
   - The last bullet in each group should be an "Implication" -- what this means operationally and what to investigate
   - Keep each bullet to one line where possible

5. GENERAL RULES:
   - Spell out specialty codes on first use (e.g., Cardiology (CARD))
   - Do NOT mention scores, conciseness, impact, HDP, extending strategies, or technical terms
   - Do NOT invent numbers not in the stats
   - Present 8-12 insights total (group related findings)
   - Keep it to 600-1000 words total
